"""Run one bench check on the robot, not in the simulator.

Stop any running main first, then run this file from the MicroPython editor.
Keep the robot still during startup gyro calibration.

CHECK choices:
	sensors: 20 raw front/side/colour/gyro samples; motors stay braked.
	gyro: rotate the robot once by a measured angle during a 10-second window.
	wheel: one 0.25-second pulse at config.BASE_SPEED; choose WHEEL below.
	speed_change: compare cached speeds with PWM register readings before and
		after set_motor_speeds(), then after drive() reapplies the same speeds.

For either motion check, raise both wheels clear of the bench, keep hands away,
and explicitly set ALLOW_MOTION = True. Keep the power switch within reach.
Speed-change pulses use config.BASE_SPEED then config.MIN_APPROACH_SPEED.
No tuning values or pass/fail limits are supplied by this diagnostic.
